    <p class="mt-[20px] text-justify">Bhutan's calendar is packed with exciting upcoming events and festivals that take place
      throughout the year. With such a diverse range of activities, it can be challenging to decide
      which ones to attend during your trip. These events are deeply rooted in Bhutanese culture and
      are based on the Buddhist calendar, resulting in public holidays occurring at various times
      throughout the year. You are guaranteed to experience at least one festival during your visit to
      Bhutan, as they are an integral part of the local culture. Even during the few months where no major
      festivals are taking place, you can still find fascinating local events that offer insight into Bhutanese
      customs and traditions.</p>
