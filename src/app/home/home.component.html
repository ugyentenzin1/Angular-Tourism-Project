      <p class="text-justify md:tracking-wide md:leading-7">Bhutan, a hidden kingdom nestled in the towering Himalayan range, is a highly coveted
        destination that even seasoned travelers consider a privilege to visit. The region boasts of ancient sacred monasteries perched on sheer cliffs,
        colorful prayer flags lining mountain ridges, and red-robed monhanting in distant temples. During Buddhist festivals,
        vibrant masked dancers perform ancient rituals on sacred Dzong (fortress) grounds. The people of Bhutan have
        a rich cultural heritage that is deeply rooted in their timeless identity. Despite opening its doors to tourism
        in 1974, the number of visitors is kept to an environmentally sustainable level through government-regulated tariffs.
        Bhutan is a predominantly Buddhist kingdom, with its people renowned for their happiness and proud of their national costume. Gagel Tours and Travels offers a unique opportunity
        to explore the awe-inspiring mysteries of the land, from snow-clad mountains, lush valleys, dense forests, and rushing streams to hidden rituals in remote monasteries
        and the daily life in far-flung rural communities. Gagel Tours and Travels provides access to the dream Himalayan adventure.

      <p class="text-justify text-black/60 md:tracking-wide md:leading-7">Opportunitiess for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered all over this planet; you just need to know where to find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re proud of our record of successful ascents (over 92% of our travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending on the route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides that make the journey itself as memorable as the summit. And if you’re not into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks and iconic treks you’ll love, too.</p>
